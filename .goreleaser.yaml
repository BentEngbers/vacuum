      # Optionally a branch can be provided.

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    # Default is false.
    skip_upload: true

    # So you can `brew test` your formula.
    # Default is empty.

    # Custom install script for brew.
    # Default is 'bin.install "program"'.
